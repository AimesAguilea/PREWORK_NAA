Module #3 - Assignment prompt on #10: fixing things takes time...

	Constently having to work through something with no true direction at times is simply going to be a reality. Troubleshooting is something i can enjoy for sure, but i know it's going to get frustrating at times. The concept of "wasted time" was mentioned in the assignment details, but i try not to think of it that why as long as i got some kind of better understanding in terms of what might have worked or what didn't work, and learning from that as quickly as possible. I beleave that in order to learn sometimes, you must actually do instead of being told what to do. You can only learn some things by actually doing those things and makeing mistakes along the way. At times, its not practical to only rely on theoreticals or hypotheticals played out in books to learn how something is done. You have to get in there in make the same mistakes that others have already made, trial and error.
