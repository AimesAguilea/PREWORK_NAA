<h2 class="bio">Bio:</h2>
    <h5 class="info">
        <p>The Mars Volta was an experimental/progressive rock band that formed in the early 2000's in El Paso, Texas. The members in the band have changed quit a bit over its history, but with that said, Omar and Cedric (the frontmen) can be considered the members that contribute the most to the nature of the band with both of them being the catalysts that created it. Their sound could be discribed as having a jazz/salsa flair to it, with Omar citing salsa music as being a big influence on him musically as a young kid growing up in his native Puerto Rico. When asked about the name of the band, Omar said that the word Volta was used frequently in a book on Frederico Fellini he read. He thought the word volta (a "turn" in a sonnet) sounded interesting, and that, jointed with the word Mars becuase it sounds cool, is how the band name came to be.</p>

        <p>The bands primary members consist of Omar Rodriguez-Lopez, the lead guitarist and musical composer, and Cedric Bixler-Zavala, the vocalist and primary songwriter. These two have been friends seens their days as teens back in El Paso and could be described as an eccentric duo of sorts.</p>
        
        <p>Cedric is known for his wild antics while performing on stage as well as for his high vocal range. He's said in interviews that his process at times for coming up with song names or writing songs is to take a bowl filled with words/phrases that he likes and pick at random. Cedric has also said before that he writes some of his lyrics based more off the sounds the words make rather than for the substance of the word itself. While Cedric has a very frantic or wild demeanor at times, he is very well spoken and articulit, especially when talking about his music.</p>

        <p>Omar on the other hand, seems to be a bit more orderly about things when it came to the band. Besides being a very talented lefty guitarist (and really only guitarist) for the band, he is also the primary decision maker when it comes to the overall "sound" and feel of the band. This included organizing the arrangment of basically all aspects of their songs and music all together, down to orchestrating how every instrument would be played to the note at times. In an interview, he mentioned that he would go as far as to record everyone's parts of a song separately so that he could communicate exactly what he wanted them to play, leaving the musicians unsure of how it sounded in relation to anything else. It wasn't uncommon for members to not hear the finished product until the very end of production. While his control over things did lead to some rough moments for the band, Omar's say in almost all aspects of the music (except the lyrics) undoubtedly lead to the success of the band.</p>
